In 1978, the farmers in a small Chinese village called Xiaogang gathered in a mud hut to sign a secret contract. They thought it might get them executed. Instead, it wound up transforming China's economy in ways that are still reverberating today. 


The contract was so risky — and such a big deal — because it was created at the height of communism in China. Everyone worked on the village's collective farm; there was no personal property. 


"Back then, even one straw belonged to the group," says Yen Jingchang, who was a farmer in Xiaogang in 1978. "No one owned anything." 


At one meeting with communist party officials, a farmer asked: "What about the teeth in my head? Do I own those?" Answer: No. Your teeth belong to the collective. 


In theory, the government would take what the collective grew, and would also distribute food to each family. There was no incentive to work hard — to go out to the fields early, to put in extra effort, Yen Jingchang says. 


"Work hard, don't work hard — everyone gets the same," he says. "So people don't want to work." 
In Xiaogang there was never enough food, and the farmers often had to go to other villages to beg. Their children were going hungry. They were desperate. 


So, in the winter of 1978, after another terrible harvest, they came up with an idea: Rather than farm as a collective, each family would get to farm its own plot of land. If a family grew a lot of food, that family could keep some of the harvest. 
This is an old idea, of course. But in communist China of 1978, it was so dangerous that the farmers had to gather in secret to discuss it. 


One evening, they snuck in one by one to a farmer's home. Like all of the houses in the village, it had dirt floors, mud walls and a straw roof. No plumbing, no electricity. 


"Most people said 'Yes, we want do it,' " says Yen Hongchang, another farmer who was there. "But there were others who said 'I dont think this will work — this is like high voltage wire.' Back then, farmers had never seen electricity, but they'd heard about it. They knew if you touched it, you would die." 


Despite the risks, they decided they had to try this experiment — and to write it down as a formal contract, so everyone would be bound to it. By the light of an oil lamp, Yen Hongchang wrote out the contract. 
The farmers agreed to divide up the land among the families. Each family agreed to turn over some of what they grew to the government, and to the collective. And, crucially, the farmers agreed that families that grew enough food would get to keep some for themselves. 


The contract also recognized the risks the farmers were taking. If any of the farmers were sent to prison or executed, it said, the others in the group would care for their children until age 18. 
The farmers tried to keep the contract secret — Yen Hongchang hid it inside a piece of bamboo in the roof of his house — but when they returned to the fields, everything was different. 


Before the contract, the farmers would drag themselves out into the field only when the village whistle blew, marking the start of the work day. After the contract, the families went out before dawn. 
"We all secretly competed," says Yen Jingchang. "Everyone wanted to produce more than the next person." 
It was the same land, the same tools and the same people. Yet just by changing the economic rules — by saying, you get to keep some of what you grow — everything changed. 


At the end of the season, they had an enormous harvest: more, Yen Hongchang says, than in the previous five years combined. 
That huge harvest gave them away. Local officials figured out that the farmers had divided up the land, and word of what had happened in Xiaogang made its way up the Communist Party chain of command. 
At one point, Yen Hongchang was hauled in to the local Communist Party office. The officials swore at him, treated him like he was on death row. 


But fortunately for Mr. Yen and the other farmers, at this moment in history, there were powerful people in the Communist Party who wanted to change China's economy. Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who would go on to create China's modern economy, was just coming to power. 


So instead of executing the Xiaogang farmers, the Chinese leaders ultimately decided to hold them up as a model. 
Within a few years, farms all over China adopted the principles in that secret document. People could own what they grew. The government launched other economic reforms, and China's economy started to grow like crazy. Since 1978, something like 500 million people have risen out of poverty in China. 


Today, the Chinese government is clearly proud of what happened in Xiaogang. That contract is now in a museum. And the village has become this origin story that kids in China learn about in school. 
But the rest of the story for the original Xiaogang farmers is more ambiguous. 
Our first day in Xiaogang, we asked to talk to Yen Hongchang, the farmer who actually wrote the contract. The local Communist Party officials told us he was out of town. 


It turns out that wasn't true: We went back to Xiaogang the next day and tracked Yen Hongchang down. He told us he had been in town the day before. 


Yen Hongchang told us he started a couple businesses over the years, but the local communist party took them away once they became profitable. He also said that the new new factories springing up around Xiaogang these days are largely empty, and haven't created many jobs. 


Local officials say none of this is true. They say everything in Xiaogang is going great.

1978年，中国一个名为小港的小村庄的农民聚集在一个泥棚里，签署了一份秘密合同。他们认为这可能会使他们被处决。相反，它以至今仍在回荡的方式结束了中国经济的转型。


这份合同是如此冒险-如此之大-因为它是在中国共产主义鼎盛时期创立的。每个人都在村庄的集体农场工作；没有个人财产。


1978年，小港的农民颜敬昌说：“那时，连一根稻草都属于这个群体。没人拥有任何东西。”


在与共产党官员的一次会面中，一位农民问：“我的牙齿怎么样？我拥有那些吗？”答：不。你的牙齿属于集体。


从理论上讲，政府将采取集体的成长，并向每个家庭分发食物。严敬昌说，没有动力去努力-早日去田野，付出额外的努力。


他说：“努力工作，不要努力工作，每个人都一样。” “所以人们不想工作。”
在小港，食物永远都不够，农民常常不得不去其他村庄乞讨。他们的孩子饿了。他们很绝望。


因此，在1978年冬天，在又一次糟糕的收成之后，他们提出了一个主意：每个家庭都可以耕种自己的土地，而不是集体耕种。如果一个家庭种植了很多食物，那么这个家庭可以保留一些收成。
当然，这是一个古老的想法。但是在1978年的中国共产党中，它是如此危险，以至于农民不得不秘密集会讨论。


一天晚上，他们一个接一个地走进农民的家。像村里的所有房屋一样，它有尘土地板，泥墙和稻草屋顶。没有管道，没有电。


“大多数人说'是的，我们要这样做。'”在那里的另一位农民颜洪昌说。 “但是，还有其他人说'我认为这行不通-这就像高压电线。'那时，农民从来没有见过电，但是他们听说过。他们知道如果触摸它，就会死。”


尽管存在风险，他们还是决定必须尝试该实验，并将其记录为正式合同，以便每个人都受其约束。颜鸿昌借助一盏油灯将合同签了出去。
农民们同意将土地分给各家庭。每个家庭都同意将他们的部分财产移交给政府和集体。而且，最重要的是，农民们同意，种植足够食物的家庭将能够自己保留一些食物。


合同还承认农民承担的风险。它说，如果有任何一个农民被送进监狱或被处决，该群体中的其他人将照看他们的孩子直到18岁。
农民试图保守合同的秘密-颜洪昌把合同藏在房子屋顶上的一块竹子里-但是当他们回到田野时，一切都变了。


在签订合同之前，只有当村里的哨子响起时，农民才会将自己拖到田里，标志着工作的开始。签订合同后，一家人在天亮前就出去了。
阎敬昌说：“我们所有人都在秘密竞争。” “每个人都想生产比下一个人更多的东西。”
那是同一块土地，同样的工具，同样的人。但是，仅通过改变经济规则（也就是说，您必须保留自己的某些增长），一切都会改变。


到了赛季末，他们有了巨大的收获：颜洪昌说，比过去五年的总和还要多。
那丰收使他们放弃了。地方官员发现，农民们已经将土地分割了，小港发生的事情的消息传到了共产党的指挥系统中。
有一次，颜洪昌被拖到当地共产党办公室。官员对他发誓，像对待他在死囚牢房一样对待他。


但是对于颜先生和其他农民来说，幸运的是，在历史的这一刻，共产党中有强大的人想要改变中国的经济。继续创造中国现代经济的中国领导人邓小平刚刚上台。


因此，中国领导人最终决定以他们为榜样，而不是处决小港农民。
几年之内，全国各地的农场都采纳了这份秘密文件中的原则。人们可以拥有自己的成长。政府发起了其他经济改革，中国经济开始疯狂增长。自1978年以来，大约有5亿人摆脱了贫困。


今天，中国政府显然为小港发生的事感到自豪。那个合同现在在博物馆里。村庄已经成为中国孩子在学校学习的起源故事。
但是对于原始的小港农民来说，其余的故事则比较模棱两可。
在小港的第一天，我们要求与实际写过《

事实并非如此：第二天我们回到小港，找到了颜宏昌。 他告诉我们他前一天去过城镇。


颜鸿昌告诉我们，这些年来，他开办了几家公司，但当地共产党一旦获利，便将其撤走。 他还说，这些天来在小港周围兴建的新工厂基本上是空的，没有创造很多工作。


当地官员说，这都不是真的。 他们说小港的一切都很好。
